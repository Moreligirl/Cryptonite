  <h2 class="display-3 my-3">About The Project</h2>

  <p>In this project, we were tasked with making an app that displays information about various crypto tokens.
    <br />
    I must say I ended up having a lot of fun just looking up random keywords in my search mechanism. They really have a
    token for everything, huh?</p>

  <p>So yeah, not really sure what to put here. I was originally gonna add some details about the choices I've made
    along the way, but there were just so many, and I suck at writing.</p>

  <p>But anyway, I'll let the site speak for itself.
    <br />
    Happy crypting! Uhh, cryptoning... Cryptoniting? Ah, who cares, go buy some shitcoin or something.
    <br />
    (And yes, Shitcoin is a real thing.)
